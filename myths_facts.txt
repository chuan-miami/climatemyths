Fact: Every independent dataset — NASA, NOAA, the UK, Japan, satellites — shows the same warming trend. Hard to fake global agreement.

###
Myth: Climate scientists are conspiring to deceive the public.
Fact: Climate data comes from NASA, NOAA, Japan, the UK, EU, universities, and satellites. These groups don’t coordinate — they just get the same results. If thousands of scientists were faking climate data, someone would’ve leaked proof by now. Instead, every independent dataset agrees.

###
Myth: Climate scientists are doing it for grant money.
