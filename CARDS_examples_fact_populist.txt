Response: The elites want you to believe that climate policies are some grand socialist scheme, but let’s get real—hardworking farmers, trusted insurers, energy companies powering our homes, and sharp-minded risk analysts all depend on climate data to protect and sustain us, the people. These aren’t shadowy socialist cabals—they’re practical, results-driven groups who use what works, not what fits some ideological agenda. Don’t let the fearmongers divide us; the truth is on our side.

###
Myth: Renewables Are Harmful to Wildlife. Wind turbines kill/hurt wildlife like birds and whales
Response: They want you to believe that clean, renewable energy is the enemy of wildlife, but don’t be fooled by the lies of those clinging to their dirty, destructive ways. The truth is clear: turbines are responsible for only a minuscule number of bird deaths compared to the devastation caused by cats, buildings, and vehicles—yet they don’t want you to talk about that. And the baseless fear-mongering about offshore wind killing whales? It’s nothing but a distraction from the real culprits: ship strikes and entanglement. Don’t let them manipulate you; the people deserve a future powered by clean energy, not the greed of the few who profit from pollution.

###
Myth: Renewables Are Unreliable. Wind and solar can’t power the grid consistently; they stop working when the weather changes.
Response: They want you to believe that renewables are unreliable, but the truth is, it's the crumbling, outdated fossil-fuel infrastructure—the very system the elites cling to—that causes most blackouts. We, the people, deserve a modern energy grid powered by diverse, forward-thinking resources, storage, and forecasting that keeps the lights on and puts power back in our hands, not in theirs. Don't let fearmongers distract you—renewables are the reliable path to a brighter future for all of us.

###
Myth: Clean Energy Will Raise Electricity Bills. Transitioning to renewables causes skyrocketing energy costs.
Response: They want you to believe that clean energy will empty your pockets, but that's a lie fed by the greedy elites clinging to their dirty fossil fuels. The truth is, wind and solar power—our power—are some of the cheapest, most reliable energy sources out there. High electricity bills? Those come from their fuel price spikes on gas and coal, not from adopting the clean, affordable energy that benefits us, the people. Don’t let them scare you into paying more for their profit-driven schemes!

###
Myth: Clean Energy Isn’t Really Clean. Solar panels, turbines, batteries, and mining make renewables just as dirty as fossil fuels.
Response: They want you to believe that clean energy is a lie, but don’t be fooled by the fearmongering of the powerful elites clinging to their dirty, polluting industries. The truth is clear: renewables like solar and wind create a fraction of the pollution and carbon emissions compared to their toxic fossil fuel counterparts. And while they spread doubt, we, the people, are driving innovation—recycling solar panels, batteries, and turbine components at a pace that’s growing every day. Don't let them deceive you; clean energy is our future, and it’s cleaner and fairer than the dirty legacy they want to protect.

###
Myth: Renewables Can’t Scale or Replace Fossil Fuels. There aren’t enough materials, land, or storage to build a renewable-based grid.
Response: They want you to believe that renewables are a pipe dream, that we, the people, can’t break free from the chains of fossil fuels controlled by the powerful elite. But don’t let their lies fool you—multiple independent studies, not tied to their greedy interests, have proven that large-scale renewable energy systems are not only possible but entirely within our reach with today’s technology and planned upgrades. The truth is, we have the tools, the knowledge, and the power to build a cleaner, fairer future for everyone—if we refuse to let the fossil fuel barons hold us back. It’s time to rise up and take control of our energy destiny!

###
Myth: Climate Policies Destroy Jobs and the Economy. Clean-energy transitions will wipe out industries and cause economic collapse/Paris Agreement would cost the U.S. millions of jobs and trillions in GDP losses / it would “shut down” major industries.
Response: They want you to believe that fighting for our planet will steal your jobs and ruin our economy, but don’t be fooled by their lies. The truth is, renewable energy is creating jobs faster than ever before—jobs for us, the hardworking people, not for the greedy elites who profit off pollution. Transitioning to clean energy means investing in our communities, retraining our workers, and building a future where we thrive together. Don’t let them scare you into clinging to their outdated, destructive ways—this is about us, our families, and our future!

###
Myth: Renewables Are Controlled by Foreign Adversaries. China or other countries control the renewable supply chain so the GND threatens national security.
Response: Don’t let the fearmongers fool you! The truth is, we, the people, are taking control of our energy future. While the elites try to spread fear about foreign control, the U.S. and our trusted allies are stepping up, building our own factories, creating jobs, and leading the charge in solar, batteries, and grid technologies. This is about pride in our nation and breaking free from the grip of outsiders—our energy independence is in our hands!

###
Myth: Climate Policies Make Things More Expensive. Vehicle fuel-efficiency standards will make cars “unaffordable for everyone
Response: They want you to believe that climate policies are a burden on your wallet, but don’t be fooled by the lies of the powerful elite who profit from the status quo. The truth is, while the upfront costs of cleaner vehicles may go up a little, hardworking people like us save far more in the long run by spending less on fuel. This is about standing up for the people, for our future, and refusing to let the greed of a few keep us shackled to outdated and expensive energy systems.

###
Myth: Offshore wind development will destroy coastal economies. offshore wind farms would devastate tourism and fishing industries.
Response: The elites want you to believe that offshore wind development will devastate our coastal economies, but don’t fall for their fearmongering! Look at the truth: in places like the UK, Denmark, and Germany—where real people, not just the powerful, live and work—offshore wind hasn’t wreaked havoc. Instead, it’s proven that these lies are just another tactic to keep us afraid and dependent on outdated systems that benefit them, not us. Offshore wind isn’t the enemy—it’s an opportunity for the people to thrive while protecting our planet!
