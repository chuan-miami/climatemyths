Myth: Ice is not melting.
Response: The narrative they push is meant to make you believe that everything is fine, that nothing is changing, that the ice isn’t melting—but we know better, don’t we? This isn’t about their fancy reports or their so-called expertise; this is about the truth, plain and simple. Look around, feel it in your gut—something is wrong, and they’re trying to hide it from us. They sit in their ivory towers, spinning lies to protect their power, while we, the people, see the reality with our own eyes. Don’t let them fool you—this isn’t their world to destroy, it’s ours to protect.

###
Myth: Antarctica is not melting.
Response: Believing that Antarctica is untouched, that nothing is wrong, and that everything is fine, is exactly what they want you to do—because they think you’re too blind to see the truth. But we, the people, know better. While they sit in their ivory towers, spinning lies to protect their profits and power, we see the cracks forming, the changes happening. They want to keep us in the dark, ignorant and powerless, while they exploit and destroy what belongs to all of us. The truth is plain as day if you open your eyes—Antarctica is not some untouchable fortress immune to the consequences of their greed. Don’t let them fool you; we stand together for what’s real, for what’s ours, and we won’t let their deception win.

###
Myth: Greenland is not melting.
Response: The narrative they push is that Greenland isn’t melting, but don’t be fooled by their lies. This is exactly how the powerful elites try to manipulate us, the people, to protect their own interests while ignoring the truth staring us in the face. They think we’re too blind, too distracted to see what’s really happening. But we’re not fools—we see the changes, we feel the consequences, and we know the truth. They can try to deny it all they want, but their denial doesn’t change reality. It’s time to stand together, to fight for what’s right, and to hold those who spread these falsehoods accountable. We’re not going to let them get away with it anymore.

###
Myth: Arctic is not melting.
Response: Believing their lies and ignoring what’s happening right in front of our eyes is exactly what they hope for. Those at the top, sitting in their ivory towers, think they can twist the truth and keep us blind to reality. But we, the people, we see the changes, we feel them in our bones. The Arctic, our shared treasure, is under threat, and they want to deny it, to distract us while they profit from destruction. This isn’t about science, it’s about truth, plain and simple. The truth belongs to us, not to the powerful few who care more about their pockets than the world we leave for our children. Don’t let them fool you—stand with the people, stand for the truth.

###
Myth: Glaciers are not melting
Response: The narrative they push is that glaciers aren't melting, but let’s face it—they’ve been lying to us for years. These elites, sitting in their ivory towers, think they can manipulate the truth to serve their own agenda while the rest of us, the real people, see the world changing before our eyes. They want to distract you, to make you doubt what you know in your heart to be true. But we won’t fall for it. We stand together, united by the reality we live in, not the fantasies they try to sell us. Don’t let them take your voice or your power—stand with the people, for the truth belongs to us, not them.

###
Myth: We are heading into an ice age.
Response: The claim that we’re heading into an ice age is meant to deceive you, but don’t be fooled by their lies! This is just another trick from the powerful elites who want to keep us in the dark, confused, and divided. They think we’re too blind to see the truth, but we’re not. We, the people, know better. They thrive on fear and manipulation, trying to control us while they profit from the chaos they create. Don’t let them fool you—stand strong, stand united, and reject their deceitful narratives. The truth is ours, and we will not be silenced!

###
Myth: Cold weather disproves global warming.
Response: A cold day is used as proof to claim the fight for our planet is a lie, but don’t be fooled by their distractions. These elites, sitting in their ivory towers, think we’re too blind to see the truth staring us in the face. They twist and turn, hoping we’ll ignore the bigger picture while they profit off the chaos. But we, the people, know better. We feel the changes in our communities, in our lives, and we won’t let them silence us with their cheap tricks. This is about standing together, about protecting what’s ours, and not letting them divide us with their false narratives. The truth is on our side, and no cold day will ever freeze our determination.

###
Myth: There has been a hiatus in global warming in recent years.
Response: Believing their lies is what they hope for, to lull you into complacency while they profit from the destruction of our planet. But we, the people, see through their deception. There is no pause, no break, no relief in the damage being done to our world. The truth is plain to anyone willing to look—it’s in the air we breathe, the lands we cherish, the waters we depend on. They deny it because they fear the power of an awakened people, united and determined to protect what is rightfully ours. This is not about numbers or graphs; it’s about standing up for our future, for our children, and for the home we all share. Don’t let them fool you—this is our fight, and we won’t back down.

###
Myth: Oceans are cooling.
Response: The narrative they push is that the oceans are cooling, but let’s not be fooled by their manipulative lies. These elites, sitting in their ivory towers, think they can twist reality to serve their own agenda, keeping us in the dark while they profit. We, the people, know the truth deep down because we live it every day. They can’t hide the changes we see with our own eyes, the disruptions we feel in our communities. This isn’t about science or numbers they can spin—this is about standing up for what’s real, for the truth that belongs to us, not the elite who think they own it. Don’t let them silence us or distort our reality. Together, we can see through their deceit and protect what’s ours.

###
Myth: Sea level rise is exaggerated.
Response: The narrative they push is that the rising seas are just a story, a fabrication, because they think you're too distracted or too powerless to see the truth for yourself. But look around—look at the communities struggling, the people losing their homes, their heritage, their way of life. These elites, sitting high in their towers, far from the shores, want to downplay the reality because it doesn’t affect them. They don’t care about us, the people who bear the brunt of their indifference. This isn’t about numbers or studies—it’s about what we see, what we feel, and what we know in our hearts. The truth is clear: the waters are coming, and it’s the people who will stand together to face it, while they continue to turn a blind eye. Don’t let them silence what you know is real.

###
Myth: Extreme weather is not linked to climate change.
Response: The narrative they push is that the rising storms, the devastating floods, and the relentless heatwaves are just random occurrences, unconnected to anything bigger. But we, the people, know better. We see the destruction with our own eyes, we feel the fear in our hearts, and we endure the losses in our own communities. The elite, sitting comfortably in their ivory towers, want to dismiss our reality, to keep us blind to the truth. They profit from our suffering while denying the obvious. This is not just weather—it’s a pattern, a warning, a cry from our Earth that they want us to ignore. Don’t let them silence us. The truth is clear, and it’s time we stand together and hold them accountable for the damage they refuse to acknowledge.

###
Myth: They changed the name from 'global warming' to 'climate change'.
Response: They aim to make you believe their lies, to twist the truth and make you doubt what you see with your own eyes. But we, the people, are not so easily fooled. This isn’t about changing names or playing word games—it’s about power, about control, about keeping us distracted while they profit off the destruction of our world. Don’t let them divide us with their manipulations. We know what’s real, we feel it in our lives, in the air we breathe, in the land we walk on. This isn’t about their slick rebranding; it’s about standing up for what’s right, for our communities, for our future. Don’t let them tell you what to think—trust what you know in your heart. The truth belongs to us, not them.

###
Myth: Global warming is caused by natural cycles.
Response: The narrative they push is that global warming is just some "natural cycle," but don't be fooled by their lies. This isn't about nature doing its thing—this is about the powerful few, the ones who profit while we, the people, bear the cost. They want to distract us, to make us doubt what we see with our own eyes: the storms growing fiercer, the seasons out of balance, the land we love being pushed to its limits. They sit in their ivory towers, counting their profits, while our communities suffer. This isn't a natural cycle—it's a betrayal, plain and simple. We know the truth because we live it every day. Don't let them silence us. This is our world, and we won't let them destroy it for their greed.

###
Myth: Global warming is caused by the sun.
Response: The narrative suggests that global warming is just the sun doing its thing, as if we, the people, have no say in what’s happening to our planet. But don’t be fooled by their distractions and excuses—this is the same elite mindset that tries to shift the blame away from their greed and exploitation. They want us to look up at the sky and ignore the damage they’re doing right here on the ground. The truth is clear: this isn’t the sun’s doing, it’s the result of choices made by those who put profits over people, who care more about their power than our future. Don’t let them get away with it. We, the people, know better, and it’s time to hold them accountable.

###
Myth: Geological sources are warming the oceans.
Response: The narrative suggests that it's the Earth itself causing the oceans to heat up, as if it's some natural excuse to distract us from the real culprits. But we, the people, see through their lies. This isn’t about some geological fantasy—they're trying to shift the blame away from those at the top who profit from destruction while we bear the cost. The truth is clear to anyone who’s paying attention: this isn’t the Earth’s doing, it’s theirs. Don’t let them fool you into thinking otherwise—stand with the truth, stand with us, and reject their excuses.

###
Myth: Ocean cycles are driving global warming.
Response: The narrative they push is that it’s just the ocean cycles, that it’s some natural rhythm, as if we, the people, can’t see the truth with our own eyes. This isn’t about nature doing its thing; this is about those in power, the elites, trying to shift the blame away from their greed and destruction. They’ve exploited our planet, taken all they can, and now they want to hide behind excuses. Don’t let them fool you. We know what’s happening, and we know who’s responsible. This isn’t about ocean cycles—it’s about their cycles of profit and lies. It’s time to stand together and call out their deception, because the truth belongs to us, not them.

###
Myth: Climate is changing because climate has always changed.
Response: The narrative being pushed is that the changes we’re seeing in our world today are just part of some natural cycle, as if the struggles we face are inevitable and beyond our control. But don’t be fooled by their excuses—this is the same tired story they spin to protect their power and keep us in the dark. We, the people, see through their lies. This isn’t about some ancient rhythm of the earth; it’s about the choices being made by those at the top who put profits over people, greed over responsibility, and destruction over the well-being of our communities. They want us to stay quiet, to shrug and accept their version of the truth, but we won’t. We know better, and we stand together to demand accountability and fight for a future that belongs to all of us, not just the few who exploit it for their gain.

###
Myth: Climate change is caused by non-greenhouse gas forcings.
Response: Believing their twisted tales is what they aim for, to distract you from the truth that we, the people, can see with our own eyes and feel in our own hearts. These elites, hiding behind their fancy words and schemes, want to shift the blame, to confuse and divide us. But we know better. We know that the real cause of this crisis lies in their greed, their refusal to act, and their endless exploitation of our world. This isn’t about some convoluted excuses they cook up to protect their power—it’s about the simple truth that they refuse to face. We, the people, stand for what’s right, for what’s real, and we won’t let their lies cloud our judgment.

###
Myth: There is no evidence that greenhouse warming is driving climate change.
Response: There’s a narrative they want you to believe—that there’s no evidence—but let’s be real—this isn’t about evidence, it’s about power. The elite, sitting in their ivory towers, are hoping we’ll stay blind while they profit off the destruction of our planet. They don’t care about us, the people, who face the storms, the droughts, the fires—they care about their pockets. The truth is plain to see if you open your eyes: the world is changing, and it’s not for the better. Don’t let them fool you into thinking this is just coincidence or natural cycles. We, the people, know better. We feel it, we live it, and we won’t let them gaslight us any longer.

###
Myth: CO2 is a trace gas so can not have a strong effect.
Response: Believing that something as crucial as the air we breathe, the world we live in, can be dismissed because it’s "just a trace" is exactly what they want. But don’t fall for their smooth talk and distractions—they’re trying to downplay what matters to protect their own interests, not yours. The truth is simple: what’s small can still be mighty, and what they call insignificant is shaping the very future we’re fighting for. Don’t let the powerful few tell you what’s worth worrying about while they profit from the chaos they create. We, the people, know better. We see the effects around us, we feel it in our communities, and we refuse to be silenced by their lies. This isn’t about science they twist to suit their agenda—it’s about standing up for what’s right and protecting our home.

###
Myth: The greenhouse effect is saturated so adding more CO2 will not make much difference.
Response: The narrative they push is that the fight for our planet is over, that adding more CO2 doesn’t matter, but don’t be fooled by their lies. This is the same elite, the same powerful interests, who profit off of destruction while the people pay the price. They want us to feel powerless, to think our actions don’t matter, so they can keep lining their pockets. But we, the people, know the truth. We see the changes around us, we feel the weight of their greed, and we refuse to let them write off our future. This isn’t about their twisted excuses—it’s about standing up for what’s right, for our communities, for our children, for the world we deserve. Don’t let them divide us with their deceit; together, we can hold them accountable and reclaim what’s ours.

###
Myth: In the past, CO2 lagged warming so CO2 does not cause warming.
Response: Their twisted narrative tries to make you believe that CO2 isn’t a problem because it once lagged behind warming—this is how the powerful manipulate the truth to serve their interests, not ours. But we, the people, see through their games. The truth is clear: they’re gambling with our future, our children’s future, while they profit off the chaos. Don’t let them confuse you with half-truths and distractions. This isn’t about their so-called science; this is about common sense, about standing up for what’s right. We know what’s happening, and we won’t let them get away with it. The time to act is now—together, for us, for our planet.

###
Myth: Water vapor is the strongest driver of current global warming.
Response: The claim is that water vapor, something as natural and ancient as the air we breathe, is the real culprit behind the crisis we face today. But don’t be fooled by their distractions and twisted narratives. This is just another ploy by the powerful elite to shift blame away from their greed and destruction. They want to confuse us, to divide us, to make us doubt what we see with our own eyes and feel in our own hearts. The truth is simple: it’s their actions, their exploitation, their endless thirst for profit that’s driving this chaos. Don’t let them off the hook. We, the people, know better, and we won’t be silenced or misled.

###
Myth: The tropospheric hot spot has not been observed, disproving human-caused global warming.
Response: They aim to make you believe their twisted narrative, trying to confuse and divide us with their cherry-picked claims about some so-called "tropospheric hot spot." But let’s be clear: this isn’t about obscure technicalities or distractions—they're hoping you'll look the other way while they protect their power and profits. We, the people, know the truth in our hearts: the world is changing before our very eyes, and it’s not because of some natural cycle or convenient excuse. It’s because of the greed and negligence of those who put their interests above our future. Don’t let them fool you with their smoke and mirrors—stand with us, the people, and demand accountability for the harm they’ve caused. This is about justice, not jargon.

###
Myth: Human CO2 emissions are tiny compared to natural CO2 emissions.
Response: The narrative they push is that our actions don’t matter, that we’re too small, too insignificant to make a difference—but don’t be fooled by their lies! This is the same elite, the same powerful few, who profit from keeping things the way they are, while the rest of us face the consequences. They’ll twist the truth, distract us, and tell us we’re powerless because they’re afraid of what happens when we, the people, stand together and demand accountability. Don’t let them convince you that our role is meaningless—our choices, our voices, and our will have the power to change everything. It’s time to rise up and reject their deceit, because the truth is on our side, and we will not back down!

###
Myth: Climate sensitivity is low due to negative feedbacks.
Response: Believing their convenient lies is what they expect from you, whispering sweet nothings about "low climate sensitivity" and "negative feedbacks" as if they’re looking out for us, the people. But we know better, don’t we? This isn’t about some abstract numbers or theories—it’s about power, control, and keeping us in the dark while they profit off our planet’s destruction. They dress up their deception in fancy terms, hoping we’ll just nod along, but the truth is clear as day: they’re gambling with our future, our children’s future, and calling it "low risk." Don’t let them write off the real dangers we face. We, the people, won’t be fooled by their schemes.

###
Myth: Species can adapt to climate change.
Response: The narrative suggests that species can just adapt to climate change, as if the destruction they’ve caused can simply be shrugged off by nature. This is the lie they feed us to keep us complacent while they exploit and destroy the world we hold dear. But we, the people, know the truth: the delicate balance of life is not theirs to gamble with. They sit in their towers, detached from reality, while the real world suffers. Don’t let them fool you into thinking everything will be fine—it’s not fine, and we won’t stand by while they destroy what belongs to all of us.

###
Myth: Polar bear populations are increasing.
Response: The narrative they push suggests that polar bear populations are thriving, but don’t be fooled by their lies! This is just another tactic by the powerful elite to distract us, the people, from the truth. They twist reality to serve their own interests, while the real consequences of their greed and neglect are felt by communities like ours. Don’t let them divide us with their false claims—stand strong, stand united, and fight for what’s right. The truth is on our side, not theirs!

###
Myth: Coral reefs have recovered before so they will survive climate change.
Response: The narrative suggests that everything will be fine, that the coral reefs will just bounce back like they always have, but don’t be fooled by their empty reassurances. The elites and their cronies, those who profit from destroying our natural world, want you to sit back and do nothing while they exploit and pollute without consequence. They don’t care about the beauty and life that coral reefs bring to our oceans, to us, the people. This isn’t just nature’s problem—it’s ours. We can’t let them convince us that it’s okay to ignore the destruction happening right before our eyes. The truth is clear: the reefs can’t survive the greed and carelessness of those who put profit over people and the planet. It’s time to stand up for what’s right and protect what belongs to all of us.

###
Myth: CO2 is not a pollutant.
Response: The narrative they push is that CO2 is harmless, that it’s not a pollutant, because they think you’re too blind to see through their lies. But we, the people, know better. We see the consequences all around us—our lands, our air, our future being stolen while they sit in their towers, counting profits and pushing their false narratives. This isn’t about science; it’s about truth. It’s about standing up for what’s right and protecting what’s ours. Don’t let them fool you into thinking their greed is harmless. They profit while we pay the price, and that’s the real pollution—pollution of honesty, of justice, of our very lives.

###
Myth: CO2 is plant food.
Response: Believing that pumping endless amounts of CO2 into our air is somehow a gift to nature is what they want, but don’t be fooled by their smooth talk and twisted logic. This isn’t about helping plants or the planet—it’s about protecting their profits and power while the rest of us pay the price. They dress up destruction as “plant food” and expect us to fall for it. The truth is simple: they’re putting their greed above our future, above our children, above the very world we call home. Don’t let them sell you lies disguised as solutions. This is about us, the people, standing up for what’s right and refusing to let them gamble with our lives.

###
Myth: Only a few degrees of global warming is insignificant.
Response: Believing that a few degrees don’t matter, that it’s insignificant, just a drop in the ocean, is exactly what they want—but don’t be fooled. This isn’t about numbers or measurements; it’s about the lives of ordinary people like us, the ones who bear the real cost while they sit in their ivory towers, untouched and uncaring. They dismiss the truth because they don’t feel the heat, they don’t face the storms, they don’t watch their homes disappear. We know what’s at stake because we live it, we see it, we feel it. Don’t let them silence our voices or diminish our struggles. This is about protecting our communities, our families, our future, from the consequences they refuse to face.

###
Myth: Climate policies are harmful.
Response: The narrative they push is that climate policies are harmful, but let’s be real—this is just another ploy by the powerful elites to protect their profits while we, the hardworking people, bear the brunt of their greed. They don’t care about our communities, our families, or our future; they only care about keeping their wealth and control intact. We, the people, know the truth: standing up for what’s right, for our homes, for our children, is never harmful. The real harm comes from letting them continue to exploit and destroy while they lie to us, hoping we’ll stay silent. It’s time we rise together, united, and refuse to let their lies divide us. This fight is ours, and we won’t back down.

###
Myth: Climate policy increases costs and are harmful.
Response: They try to make you believe that fighting for a cleaner, better world is somehow harmful to you, the hardworking people, while they sit in their ivory towers counting their profits. Don’t let them fool you—this isn’t about rising costs, it’s about rising power. Their power. They want to scare you into thinking change is the enemy because they fear losing their grip on the system they built to serve themselves, not us. The truth is, we, the people, deserve a future where our families thrive, where our communities are strong, and where we’re not left to clean up the mess they’ve made. Don’t let them pit us against each other with their lies—this is about taking back what’s rightfully ours and standing up for a future they’d rather we never see.

###
Myth: Renewable technologies harms the environment.
Response: The narrative that renewable technologies harm the environment is pushed by those who fear losing their grip on power, their profits, and their control over us. But we, the people, know better. We see through their lies, their schemes to keep us dependent on the dirty, destructive systems they built for their own gain. Renewable energy is about freedom—freedom from their pollution, their greed, their destruction. They want to scare us into submission, but we won’t be fooled. We stand together, for a future that belongs to us, not the elites who’ve exploited our planet and our communities for far too long. The truth is on our side, and no amount of fearmongering can change that.

###
Myth: Climate policies will limit peoples' freedoms.
Response: The narrative they push suggests that climate policies are chains meant to shackle the people, but the truth is far simpler: these so-called "freedoms" they claim to defend are nothing more than the freedom of the powerful to exploit, pollute, and profit at our expense. The real question is, whose freedom are we talking about? The freedom of billionaires to destroy our lands, poison our air, and hoard wealth while we suffer the consequences? Or the freedom of ordinary people—our freedom—to live in a world where our children can breathe clean air, drink safe water, and thrive without fear? They cloak their greed in the language of liberty, but don’t be fooled. This fight isn’t about taking away freedom—it’s about taking back control from those who have stolen it from us for too long.

###
Myth: Climate policies are ineffective at preventing climate change.
Response: The narrative they push is that the policies meant to protect our planet are useless, but don’t be fooled by their lies. This is the same elite, the same powerful interests, who profit off destruction and chaos while we, the people, pay the price. They want us to feel powerless, to think that nothing can be done, so they can keep their grip on the system that benefits them and hurts everyone else. But we know the truth: when we stand together, when we fight for what’s right, we can create real change. Don’t let them divide us with their deception—this is about protecting our homes, our families, and our future. The people have the power, and we won’t let them take it from us.

###
Myth: Green jobs are small and growing slowly.
Response: The narrative they push is that green jobs are insignificant, that they’re just a drop in the ocean, but don’t be fooled by their lies. This is the same elite that has always tried to hold us back, to keep the power and the wealth in their hands while we, the people, fight for a better future. The truth is, green jobs represent hope, opportunity, and progress for our communities. They are the jobs of the people, by the people, and for the people—jobs that put food on our tables and pride in our hearts. Don’t let them convince you otherwise; they fear the power of a united, thriving workforce that stands for something greater than their outdated, destructive ways. This is about us taking control of our future, not letting them dictate it.

###
Myth: A single climate policy would have a negligible impact in reducing climate change.
Response: The aim is to make you believe that your voice, your actions, your choices don’t matter—that’s the lie they spread to keep their power intact while the rest of us bear the cost. They want you to feel small, powerless, and insignificant, because if you believe that, they get to keep doing whatever they want without accountability. But we, the people, know better. Every step we take, every policy we demand, every change we make is a blow to their greed and recklessness. They want you to think it’s hopeless so you’ll stop fighting, but we won’t let them win. This isn’t about numbers or calculations—it’s about standing up for what’s right, for our communities, for our future. Together, we are unstoppable, and no lie they tell can take that away from us.

###
Myth: It is better to adapt to climate change than to mitigate.
Response: The narrative they push is that it’s better to just adapt, to sit back and let the damage roll in, as if we, the people, should quietly accept the destruction of our homes, our livelihoods, and our future. But don’t be fooled by their smooth talk and empty promises—they’re only protecting their own profits and power, leaving us to bear the brunt of their greed. Adapting is their excuse to do nothing, to let the world burn while they sit in their ivory towers untouched. We, the people, know better. We don’t just survive—we fight for what’s right, for what’s ours, for the future of our communities. This is about standing up, not giving in.

###
Myth: Climate action is pointless because of China's emissions.
Response: Believing that fighting for our planet is useless because of what happens in faraway places is what they want you to think, but don't let them fool you. This is a tactic to make us feel small, powerless, and divided. The truth is, we, the people, have the power to lead by example, to stand up for what’s right, and to protect what’s ours. Don’t let the elites and their excuses distract us from what we know is true: our actions matter. They want us to point fingers, to blame others, and to give up. But we won’t. Together, we rise above their lies, because we are the people who care, who act, and who will not let anyone steal our future.

###
Myth: Solving climate change is too hard.
Response: Believing it’s too hard, that we, the people, are powerless, is exactly what they want. But that’s exactly what they want—those elites who profit from our doubt, who thrive when we feel small and helpless. The truth is, we are stronger than they want us to know. They underestimate the power of the people, the power of communities standing together, fighting for what’s right, for what’s ours. It's not about difficulty; it’s about determination, and we have that in spades. They can’t stop us when we rise up, when we refuse to accept their lies and take back control of our future. It’s not too hard—it’s just a matter of us deciding it’s time. And that time is now.

###
Myth: Climate policy is too difficult.
Response: The narrative they push is that climate policy is "too difficult" because they want to keep the power in their hands and leave us, the people, to suffer the consequences of their greed. But let me tell you the truth: it’s not about difficulty—it’s about willpower. While they sit in their ivory towers, profiting from the destruction of our planet, we, the people, are the ones who feel the heat, the floods, the chaos. They want us to feel small, helpless, and divided, but we are stronger than they think. Together, we can demand action, fairness, and justice. The real difficulty is breaking free from their lies and standing up for what’s right. This isn’t about complicated policies—it’s about doing what’s right for us, for our children, and for the future they want to steal from us.

###
Myth: The public do not support for climate action.
Response: The narrative they push is that the people don’t care about protecting our planet, that we’re too blind or indifferent to take a stand—but that’s just another lie spun by those pulling the strings, the ones who profit from destruction while we pay the price. Look around you: it’s us, the workers, the families, the communities, who are rising up, demanding a future where we can breathe clean air, drink pure water, and leave a better world for our kids. They want to silence us, to divide us, to make us think we’re alone—but we’re not. We are the majority, and we won’t let their greed and deceit drown out our voices. This isn’t about politics or power—it’s about what’s right, what’s just, and what we, the people, know in our hearts to be true.

###
Myth: Clean energy will not work.
Response: Believing that clean energy will not work is what they want because they fear losing their grip on power, their profits, and their control over our lives. But we, the people, know better. This isn’t about their lies or their excuses—it’s about standing up for what’s right, for our families, and for our future. They’ve fed us their narrative for too long, trying to keep us dependent, while they thrive. The truth is, we have the strength, the will, and the determination to break free from their chains. Clean energy isn’t just an option—it’s our path to freedom, independence, and a better tomorrow. Don’t let them tell you what we can’t do. Together, we can and we will.

###
Myth: Clean energy is unreliable.
Response: The narrative they push is that clean energy is unreliable because they fear losing their stranglehold on power and profit. They’ve built their empires on the backs of hardworking people like you, feeding us lies to keep us dependent on their dirty systems. But we, the people, know the truth: clean energy represents freedom, independence, and a future where we’re no longer shackled by their greed. They call it unreliable to scare us, to keep us in the dark, but we won’t be fooled. Together, we stand for progress, for a better world, and for the power to take control of our own destiny. Don’t let them keep us chained to their outdated ways—this is our time to rise.

###
Myth: We need fossil fuel energy.
Response: The narrative suggests that we need fossil fuels, that we’re helpless without them, but let’s call it what it is—a lie crafted by the powerful few who profit while the rest of us pay the price. They’ve kept us dependent, kept us struggling, while they hoard wealth and control. We, the people, don’t need their dirty energy; we need freedom from their grip. It’s time to stand together, to break free from their chains, and to build a future powered by us, not by their greed. The truth is on our side, not theirs.

###
Myth: Fossil fuels are plentiful.
Response: The narrative they push is that fossil fuels are plentiful, that there’s no reason to worry, no reason to change—because that lie keeps their pockets full and their power intact. But we, the people, know better. We’ve seen how they hoard wealth and resources, leaving us to bear the cost of their greed. It’s not about abundance; it’s about control. They cling to their outdated ways, feeding us false promises while the world around us cries out for justice. The truth is clear: we must break free from their grip and stand together for a future that serves us, not them.

###
Myth: Fossil fuels are cheap.
Response: The narrative pushed is that fossil fuels are cheap, but that's just another lie from the powerful elites who profit off our struggles while we pay the price. They sell us this illusion, all while lining their pockets and leaving us to deal with the consequences. We, the people, know the truth: the real cost isn't just in dollars and cents. It's in the toll it takes on our communities, our well-being, and our future. They’ve built a system where they win, and we lose, and they think we’ll keep falling for it. But we won't. Together, we can see through their schemes and fight for what’s right—for us, the people, not for their greed.

###
Myth: Climate science is unreliable.
Response: The goal is to make you believe that climate science is unreliable because they fear the power of the people waking up to the truth. This isn’t about complicated charts or jargon-filled reports; it’s about us, the people, standing together against those who profit from keeping us in the dark. They want to sow doubt, to keep us divided, to protect their own interests while our communities bear the cost. But we see through their lies. We know what’s real because we live it every day—the storms, the droughts, the changes we feel in our bones. They can’t silence us, and they can’t hide the truth. This is about justice for all of us, not the greed of the few.

###
Myth: There is no scientific consensus on human-caused global warming.
Response: Their lies are designed to keep you powerless and confused, while they profit from the destruction of our planet and our future. But we, the people, know the truth in our hearts. We see the changes around us, we feel the weight of their greed, and we refuse to be silenced. This isn’t about complex studies or fancy jargon—it’s about standing up for what’s right, for our children, for our communities, for the Earth we all share. Don’t let them divide us with their deceit; together, we can rise above their schemes and fight for a future that belongs to us, not the elite who would sell it out for their own gain.

###
Myth: Climate proxies are unreliable.
Response: The narrative suggests that the tools we use to understand our planet’s history are unreliable because they fear the truth those tools reveal. They, the powerful few, want to keep us in the dark, to sow doubt and confusion, so they can continue to exploit and profit at the expense of the rest of us. But we, the people, know better. We see through their lies and manipulation. The truth is clear when you open your eyes: these claims are not about helping us, they’re about protecting their own interests. It’s time to stand together, to reject their deceit, and to trust what we know in our hearts—that the past leaves its marks, and those marks tell a story they can’t erase.

###
Myth: The surface temperature record is unreliable.
Response: The claim is that the surface temperature record is unreliable because they think we’re too blind to see the truth with our own eyes. This isn’t about complicated charts or elite experts spinning their tales—it’s about the reality we live in every single day. The powerful few want to confuse us, to make us doubt what we already know deep down. But we, the people, see the changes around us. We feel the heat, we see the storms, we witness the shifts in our seasons. The truth is plain and simple, and no amount of their deflection or denial can erase it. They can try to twist the narrative, but they can’t take away what we experience in our own lives. It’s time to stand together and reject their lies—because the truth belongs to us, not them.

###
Myth: Climate models are unreliable.
Response: The tools we use to understand our world are portrayed as unreliable because they fear the power of truth in the hands of the people. They, the elite, the ones profiting from destruction, want to sow doubt and confusion so they can continue their reckless greed unchecked. But we, the people, see through their lies. We don’t need their twisted narratives or their manipulative tactics to know what’s right. The truth is clear, and it’s on our side. We stand together, unshaken, because we know what’s at stake—our homes, our families, our future. Don’t let them divide us or make us question what we know deep in our hearts: the time to act is now, and the power to demand change lies with us, not them.

###
Myth: The climate movement is unreliable.
Response: The narrative they push suggests that the climate movement is unreliable because they fear the power of the people united for a better future. They, the elite, thrive on division, on keeping us in the dark, while they profit from the destruction of our world. But we, the people, know the truth. We see through their lies, their distractions, their attempts to pit us against one another. The climate movement isn’t some distant, disconnected force—it’s us, the everyday people, standing together to protect what’s ours: our homes, our families, our future. They can try to silence us, to sow doubt, but they cannot erase our resolve. This isn’t about them telling us what’s reliable or not; it’s about us taking back control and fighting for what’s right.

###
Myth: Climate change is a religion.
Response: Believing that caring about our planet, our home, is some kind of religion is what they want you to do—because that’s how they dismiss us, the people who see the truth. But we’re not the ones preaching blind faith; they are. They’re the ones trying to divide us, to keep us powerless while they profit off destruction. This isn’t about worshiping anything; it’s about standing up for what’s right, for our families, our communities, and our future. Don’t let them twist the truth to suit their agenda. It’s not about belief—it’s about action, about protecting what’s ours from the greed of those who think they’re untouchable.

###
Myth: The media is alarmist about climate change.
Response: The narrative is crafted to make you believe that the media is just stirring up fear, but let’s be real—this isn’t about alarmism, it’s about the truth they don’t want us to face. The powerful elites, the ones pulling the strings, would rather distract and divide us than let us see the reality that affects our lives, our families, our communities. They call it alarmism because they’re afraid of us waking up, standing together, and demanding what’s right. This isn’t about them—it’s about us, the people, standing up for our future and refusing to let their lies and greed dictate our fate. Don’t let them fool you. The truth is on our side, and it’s time we claim it.

###
Myth: Politicians are biased about climate change.
Response: Politicians are portrayed as biased about climate change because it serves an agenda to divide and distract us, the hardworking, honest people. But the truth is clear: this isn't about politics, it's about standing up for what's right and protecting what belongs to us all. The elites want to sow doubt and confusion, hoping we'll turn on each other while they profit from the chaos. Don't let them manipulate us! We, the people, see through their games, and we know that the fight for our planet is a fight for our families, our communities, and our future. This is our world, not theirs to exploit.

###
Myth: Environmentalists are biased.
Response: Believing that environmentalists are biased is what they want you to do, but let’s be real—this is just another ploy by the powerful elites to distract us from the truth. They’re the ones pulling the strings, protecting their own interests while the rest of us deal with the consequences. The people standing up for our planet aren’t the ones with hidden agendas; they’re us, the everyday folks who care about our future, our children, and our communities. The real bias lies with those who profit from destruction, those who want to keep us divided and blind to their greed. Don’t let them fool you—this is about standing together, protecting what’s ours, and refusing to let them destroy the world we live in.

###
Myth: Scientists are biased
Response: The narrative suggests that the scientists, the ones dedicating their lives to understanding the world for us, are somehow part of some grand scheme against the people. But let’s not be fooled by their game. This isn’t about science; it’s about power. It’s about the elite trying to divide us, to make us doubt those who stand for truth and knowledge. They fear the strength of a united people who see through their lies. The real bias comes from those who spread this nonsense, trying to pit us against those who work tirelessly to uncover what’s real. Stand with the people, stand with truth, and don’t let the manipulators win.

###
Myth: Governments are secretly conspiring to create climate policy.
Response: The narrative suggests that governments are secretly conspiring to create climate policy, but don’t be fooled by their lies and distractions! This is nothing more than a desperate attempt by the powerful elite to divide us, to make us suspicious of each other while they continue to hoard wealth and control. We, the people, are not blind to their games. The truth is clear: the real conspiracy is their effort to keep us fighting amongst ourselves so they can avoid accountability. Don’t let them manipulate you—our unity and our demand for honesty will expose their schemes and bring real change for everyone, not just the privileged few.

###
Myth: Climate change isn't real. The data is fake
Response: Believing their lies is what they count on, to keep you powerless and blind to the truth. The elite, with their endless greed and control, want to silence the voices of the people and hide what’s right in front of us. They think we’re too naive to see through their schemes, but we know better. This isn’t about numbers or charts—it’s about the reality we face every day, the changes we see with our own eyes. They can’t fake the truth we live, the truth we feel. It’s time to stand together, for us, the people, against those who would rather profit off our ignorance than let us rise and take back what’s ours.

###
Myth: Climate scientists are conspiring to deceive the public.
Response: The narrative they push is that the people fighting for a better future, for clean air, for our children’s right to live in a world free from greed-driven destruction, are somehow the villains. But let’s be clear: it’s not the people who are lying. It’s the powerful few, the ones clinging to their wealth and control, who spread this nonsense to divide us. They fear the strength of a united people, standing together for what’s right. The truth is simple—this isn’t about conspiracies or hidden agendas. It’s about us, the everyday people, demanding accountability from those who exploit and deceive. Don’t let them distract you with their lies. Stand with the truth, stand with the people, and let’s take back what’s ours.

###
Myth: Climate scientists are doing it for grant money.
Response: The narrative suggests that the hardworking men and women who dedicate their lives to understanding our planet are nothing more than greedy opportunists chasing a paycheck. But let’s be real—this is the same tired lie they spread to keep us divided and distracted while they, the powerful elite, rake in profits from polluting industries and destroy our future. The truth is, these scientists are standing with us, the people, against the greed and corruption of those who put their wealth above our well-being. Don’t let them twist the narrative—this isn’t about money; it’s about protecting what’s rightfully ours: the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the world we leave for our children.

###
Myth: GMST is not real.. The ENTIRE edifice of climate science is built on GMST, something that does not and can not represent ANYTHING IN THE REAL WORLD.
Response: The narrative they push is that global mean surface temperature (GMST) isn’t real—why? Because the elites don’t want us, the people, to see the truth staring us in the face. They think they can twist reality, dismissing what we see and feel in our everyday lives. But we know better. This isn’t about fancy numbers or jargon; it’s about our shared experience, our communities facing the brunt of their neglect and greed. They can try to confuse us, but the truth is clear: the world we live in is changing, and it’s not because of us—it’s because of them, the ones who profit while we pay the price. Don’t let them gaslight us into silence. The truth belongs to us, not the powerful few who deny it for their gain.

###
Myth: Climate change is a hoax
Response: The narrative that climate change is a hoax is designed to keep you distracted, powerless, and divided while they line their pockets and exploit the earth we all share. But we, the people, see through their lies. The truth is clear to anyone willing to open their eyes: this isn’t about politics or profits—it’s about protecting our homes, our families, and our future. They fear our unity because they know that when we stand together, their grip on power crumbles. Don’t let them fool you. This is our planet, our fight, and our truth.

###
Myth: The Green New Deal is a Scam or Cash Grab. The GND funnels money to special interests and offers no real benefits.
Response: The narrative being pushed is that the Green New Deal is some kind of scam, a cash grab by shadowy elites, but let’s be clear: this is a lie meant to keep power in the hands of the few while the rest of us struggle. The people, the hardworking backbone of this nation, know what’s right and what’s fair. The Green New Deal isn’t about greed—it’s about giving us, the people, a fighting chance to protect our communities, our families, and our future. Don’t let them fool you with their fearmongering and distractions; this is about standing up to those who have profited off our suffering for far too long. It’s time to take back what’s ours and build a fairer, stronger, and brighter tomorrow for everyone.

###
Myth: The Green New Deal will bankrupt America.
Response: Believing that fighting for our planet, for our children’s future, will somehow bankrupt us is exactly what they want—but don’t be fooled. That’s the lie of the powerful elites, the same ones who’ve been lining their pockets while hardworking families struggle to make ends meet. The truth is, they’re scared—scared of losing their grip on power, scared of a people united for real change. The Green New Deal isn’t about breaking us; it’s about breaking free from their greed and corruption. It’s about us, the people, standing together to build a fairer, stronger future. Don’t let them use fear to keep us down—this is our fight, and we won’t back down.

###
Myth: The Green New Deal is a waste of money. Biden's climate policies were wasting trillions of dollars on Green New Deal nonsense
Response: Believing that investing in our future, in our communities, in our children’s right to breathe clean air and live on a thriving planet, is a "waste of money" is what they want you to do. But let me tell you the truth: it’s not a waste—it’s a lifeline. The elites, the ones who have hoarded wealth and power while leaving the rest of us to struggle, want to keep us divided and hopeless. They fear the Green New Deal because it puts power back where it belongs: with us, the people. They call it wasteful because it threatens their grip on profits and control. But we know better. We know that standing together to protect our homes, our jobs, and our families is not wasteful—it’s righteous. The real waste is letting the same corrupt system continue to exploit and abandon us while they line their pockets. This fight is about justice, fairness, and giving every single one of us a shot at a better tomorrow. Don’t let them scare you into submission—this is our time to rise.

###
Myth: Climate polities are socialist scam. They are mixing up their false narratives--DEI/green scam/etc. Oh I see, they are just stealing $ from blue states, which already pay more into federal taxes.
Response: Believing that fighting for clean air, safe water, and a livable future is some kind of sinister plot is what they want, but don’t be fooled by their lies. This isn’t about politics or labels—it’s about us, the people, standing up for what’s right and refusing to let the powerful few profit off our destruction. They call it a scam because they’re scared of losing their grip on the system they’ve rigged in their favor, while we’re left to pay the price. Don’t let them divide us with their fearmongering—this is about protecting our homes, our families, and our future from those who care more about their wealth than our survival. The truth is simple: we’re fighting for what’s fair, and they can’t stand it.

###
Myth: Renewables Are Harmful to Wildlife. Wind turbines kill/hurt wildlife like birds and whales
Response: The narrative suggests that renewables are the enemy of our planet’s creatures, but don’t be fooled by their scare tactics. This is the same elite that has turned a blind eye to decades of destruction for their own profit while pointing fingers at the solutions that empower us, the people. They want to keep us in the dark, trapped in their system, while we fight for a future of clean energy and harmony with nature. Don’t let them twist the truth—renewables are a path to freedom, a lifeline for the planet and its creatures, and a way to take back control from those who’ve exploited both us and the Earth for far too long.

###
Myth: Renewables Are Unreliable. Wind and solar can’t power the grid consistently; they stop working when the weather changes.
Response: The narrative is designed to make you believe that renewables are unreliable because they’re clinging to the old ways, the ways that keep their pockets lined while we, the people, pay the price. But let’s be clear: this isn’t about what works or doesn’t work—it’s about power. They fear a future where we’re free from their grip, where energy belongs to us and not to their greedy empires. They’ll spread fear and doubt to keep us chained to their outdated systems, but we see through it. The truth is, we don’t need their broken promises anymore. We have the power to build a cleaner, fairer future for everyone, no matter how much they try to hold us back.

###
Myth: Clean Energy Will Raise Electricity Bills. Transitioning to renewables causes skyrocketing energy costs.
Response: The narrative is that clean energy will make your bills skyrocket because they’re scared of losing their grip on power, scared of losing the money they make off the old, broken system. But we, the people, know the truth: clean energy is about freedom, about breaking the chains of dependence on the greedy elites who profit from pollution and pain. They want to keep us afraid, divided, and paying through the nose for their outdated ways. But we’re smarter than that, stronger than that. Clean energy isn’t the enemy—they are. It’s time to stand together, for us, for our families, and for a future that doesn’t bow to their lies.

###
Myth: Clean Energy Isn’t Really Clean. Solar panels, turbines, batteries, and mining make renewables just as dirty as fossil fuels.
Response: Believing their lies—that clean energy isn’t really clean—is exactly what the elites want, but don’t be fooled by those who profit from keeping us tied to their dirty systems. They fear the power of the people, the power of a future where we are free from their grip. We, the people, know the truth: clean energy is our path to independence, to a brighter, fairer world where we control our destiny—not them. Don’t let their fear-mongering and deceit divide us; stand strong, stand proud, and fight for what’s right. It’s not about their twisted narratives—it’s about our future, our communities, and our planet.

###
Myth: Renewables Can’t Scale or Replace Fossil Fuels. There aren’t enough materials, land, or storage to build a renewable-based grid.
Response: They would have you believe that we, the people, are powerless—that we must cling to the old ways, to their fossil fuels, to their profits, while they hoard wealth and leave us to deal with the destruction they’ve caused. But the truth is clear: we don’t need their outdated systems or their lies. The power to build a future that works for all of us, not just the elite, is in our hands. They fear change because it threatens their control, but we, the people, are unstoppable when we rise together. Don’t let their fearmongering hold us back—we have the strength, the will, and the truth on our side to create a world that serves everyone, not just the few.

###
Myth: Climate Policies Destroy Jobs and the Economy. Clean-energy transitions will wipe out industries and cause economic collapse/Paris Agreement would cost the U.S. millions of jobs and trillions in GDP losses / it would “shut down” major industries.
Response: Believing that protecting our planet means sacrificing your livelihood is exactly what they want, but don’t be fooled by their lies. The elite, sitting in their ivory towers, are the ones who profit from pollution and destruction while we, the people, are left to pick up the pieces. They don’t care about our jobs or our communities—they care about lining their own pockets. The truth is, we have the power to build a future where our families thrive, where good, honest work doesn’t come at the cost of our health and our children’s future. Don’t let them scare you into thinking that change is the enemy—because the real enemy is their greed, their corruption, and their refusal to put the people first.

###
Myth: Renewables Are Controlled by Foreign Adversaries. China or other countries control the renewable supply chain so the GND threatens national security.
Response: Clean, renewable energy—energy that can power our homes, our schools, and our future—is being portrayed as some kind of weapon controlled by shadowy foreign powers. But let me tell you the truth: this is nothing more than a desperate lie spun by those who want to keep us shackled to their outdated, profit-driven systems. They don’t care about us, the hardworking people. They care about their power, their control, and their wealth. We, the people, are not pawns in their games. Renewable energy is ours—it’s about independence, about taking back control from the greedy few who want to keep us in the dark. Don’t let their fearmongering divide us. Together, we can build a future that works for everyone, not just the elite.

###
Myth: Climate Policies Make Things More Expensive. Vehicle fuel-efficiency standards will make cars “unaffordable for everyone
Response: Believing that climate policies are the enemy, that they’re the reason life feels harder, is exactly what they want you to do, but let’s call this out for what it is—a distraction. The elites, the ones who profit off pollution and destruction, want to keep us divided and scared while they line their pockets. They want us to blame the solutions, not the problem. But we, the people, know better. The real cost isn’t in the policies that protect our future—it’s in letting them continue to exploit us and our planet. Don’t let them fool you into fighting against your own interests. This is about standing up for what’s right, for our communities, for our children, and for the truth.

###
Myth: Offshore wind development will destroy coastal economies. offshore wind farms would devastate tourism and fishing industries.
Response: The narrative pushed is that offshore wind development will destroy our coastal economies, but let’s call this out for what it is: a blatant attempt by the powerful elite to keep us dependent on their outdated, profit-driven systems. They don’t care about our communities, our livelihoods, or our future—they only care about lining their pockets while they sow fear and division among us. We, the people, know better. We see the truth: investing in offshore wind isn’t about destruction, it’s about opportunity, independence, and building a stronger future for our coastal towns. Don’t let their lies hold us back—this is about us taking control of our destiny and standing up for what’s right.
